## Game Overview

This project covers developing two exact versions of the same game using Unity's **Netcode for GameObject** and **Netcode for Entities** frameworks.

The resulting game is a multiplayer arena where players can create lobbies and fight against two types of AI-controlled enemies: **Rogues** and **Slimes**.
